# Masking-Spectral-Crop-Data
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that analyzes a wide spectrum of light instead of just assigning primary colors (red, green, blue) to each pixel. HSI is used across many applications within the field of biosystems engineering, including agricultural production, food processing, microbial analysis, and more. Given its high spectral resolution, HSI can provide unique signatures that enable the detection and quantification of biological, chemical, and physical phenomena.
